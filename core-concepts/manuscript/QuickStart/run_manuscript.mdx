## Deployment Options

Edit and deploy your Manuscript directly within the GUI. This is the most straightforward and efficient method.

### 2. ðŸšŒ Using Docker Compose
Copy the docker-compose file from the [Manuscript-Core](https://github.com/chainbase-labs/manuscript-core/tree/main/examples) repository to deploy it locally.

### 3. ðŸš… Using Manuscript-Lib (Coming Soon)
Deploy your Manuscript with a single click through the Manuscript-Lib browser.
